The people of [[Eldercoast]] are scared of the merchant guild of Talian.

[[Lemuru]] overheard Talian during the infiltration of Talians castle that Talian really wants the [[Evidense Journal]]. This conversation was held by Talian and a mysterious hooded man who was followed into a, what seemed like, a thieves guild.
