Started of at a catacomb in the city of [[Andora]]. In this catacomb we found the [[Hero of the sword]]. We stole its sword and gave it to [[Elisabeth]]. After that we slayed a Dracohydra and received 5 gems from it. That [[Terilin]] brought the gems to [[Leylin]] to learn more about it. The gems were Eldunary. 

We questioned 5 different people that the bishop advised to handle stuff in [[Andora]].
1. Slimebal
2. Open - honest
3. Shit
4. Shit
5. Shit
Nr 2 isnt loyal, he has a side-eye for money. He wants lands in the inner-city. His name is [[Hendrikson]]. The Dracohydra was looted for scales, fangs and claws. 

The party made their way to the [[Dwarven Hold]] before all the energy is dissipated to imbue something each. The hold of a blue adult dragon was in the mountains. Once we entered we found a darkened foggy room where we encountered the blue adult dragon. We slayed him and [[Terilin]] received the hearts and soul. After killing the dragon we took a long rest and got captured  by [[The Empire]]. We escapes, found our gear and killed like 40 guards. In the [[Dwarven Hold]] we freed the youngest dwarf and the rest of the party. Oldest dwarf and arch mage [[Leylin]] are still missing. We entered the hold, killed 2 soldiers and took their clothing for disguises. We chopped them into pieces and discarded them into the toilet.

We persuaded the guards at the gate and found out that the superior was on the 2nd story of a hexagonal shaped dome. The dome is a temple. Underneath it is a prison that can hold 1 person. The dwarf families are hold captive underneath the hold. In total there a re 87 patrols, 4 mages and 300 soldiers in the outer hold. [[Antropos]] expects a report within 16 hours. We went to the [[Temple of Moradin]] and found [[Antropos]] in the middle of the room doing an incantation with the 5 gems floating above his head. We interrupted his incantation and fought him. During the fight we freed [[Leylin]] from that room and fled to the outer wall. [[Leylin]] teleported us after we escaped to [[Hydron]], the city of the dwarfs. 

[[Highlord Marshal]] was making his way to [[Hydron]]. Here we went to [[Baron Bardok]], he has pledged his loyalty to [[Terilin]] but the elders might not. We found out that on top of the mountain there is a plateau where the dwarf god is praised and there is a spiral staircase into the mountain that leads to [[Dwarven Hold]]. 

The party took off towards the mountain from [[Hydron]] to attack the hold with an army of dwarfs. The plan is to polymorph ourselves up the mountain and make preparations with [[Leylin]]. Meanwhile [[Geist]] enters the hold and starts the dwarven revolution. On the plateau a glyph of warding was placed, everyone drank a potion of heroism and [[Kurgan]] drank a potion of growth. We defeated [[Antropos]].

The party entered the stronghold and freed the dwarfs. Peace is back in the hold and the army is gone. We imbued our items.

Then the party went to [[Baron Bardok]] and he was pleased and is willing to help us.

[[Geist]] used an old teleport circle in the stronghold to investigate the other side of the teleport. We ended up in the catacombs of [[Gamblion]]. In these catacombs we found a court wizard names [[Maverick]] doing some kind of research. He was guarded by it seemed like undeath guards. 

[[Highlord Marshal]] and [[Lord Warden Feral]] were informed by what we found. And we needed to go to [[Fallcrest]] because there is a army coming from the east that consist of multiple wild races. Its an army against slavery. [[Saladin]] is leading the army. We send [[Kurgan]] as an emissary for a diplomatic talk. The army consists mostly of demi-humans.

After a while the party left towards the camp where the army is as well where we encountered a loxodon called [[Aldon]] and a tabaxi names [[Twig]]. We sneaked into the camp where [[Geist]] had an epic entrance in the tent with all the leaders, including [[Saladin]]. They don't want to attack and are not associated with [[The Empire]] anymore. We got [[Aldon]] and [[Twig]] with an additional 10 warriors as a warparty. We went to the kobalt stronghold to get [[Kurgan]].

After that we went back to [[Fallcrest]] and went through the portal which leads to the catacombs of [[Gamblion]]. We met again with [[Maverick]] and said he doesn't like working for [[The Empire]] but doesn't want to die. So instead he helps them with research.

In the catacombs we found a mirror where [[Geist]] went through and we seemed to be a one-way portal. He got into a fight with a couple drow. To save him we needed to go through the catacombs and find him. He found 5 rooms in a corridor where in the 3rd room we found murals from historical events and an altar of [[Sindor]]. At the altar we found a drow praying. His name is [[Flonwelf]] of house [[Aufwyndor]]. We found out he is a spy of the house of [[Freth]]. He told us of a secret door to a hallway next to him with drows at a door. [[Rigs]] and [[Terilin]] both casted fireball to kill all drows. Behind the door was [[Geist]]. We went back to [[Flonwelf]] and helped him rescued his buddy that was being a captive in the catacombs.

After we saved [[Geist]] we reunited with [[Narak]] and continued the catacombs. We found a wall with magical darkness with 10 drow with crossbows and 1 female drow and a monk. After the start of combat we encountered an additional enemy, the should golem. We killed them all and [[Rigs]] received the master's amulet to control the golem.

After combat we found an illusionary wall with a giant door behind it. We entered the room and closed the door. The door could only be opened by the family of the bloodline of [[Gamblion]]. Inside the room there was a giant red eldunary and a spear on an altar. We picked up the spear and gave it to [[Narak]]. [[Geist]] started to telepathically talk with the dragon in the eldunary. His name was [[Glauron]], son of [[Ashardalon]]. [[Terilin]] casted detect thoughts on the dragon and overheard the conversation. She interpeted it as if [[Geist]] was making a deal with the dragon for power. So [[Terilin]] casted dominate person on [[Geist]] and forced him to break the telepathic link. [[Rigs]] noticed that there was something off with [[Geist]] and used his golem to grapple [[Terilin]]. He prepared an eldritch blast and questioned [[Geist]] and [[Terilin]].  Once he noticed that it was not [[Geist]] speaking but [[Terilin]], he shot the eldritch blast at [[Terilin]] to break the concentration. [[Geist]] was back himself and a separation was created within the party. The conversation started to escalate but did not reach the point of a fight. Since only [[Terilin]] could open the door meant that the party was stuck. [[Terilin]] opened the door and [[Geist]] and [[Rigs]] left the party. Their freedom was robbed, even only if it was for a minute.

[[Terilin]] and [[Narak]] also left the vault. They encountered [[Nareau]] but did not want to interact with him. While invisible they passed him towards the portal. They entered the room where [[Maverick]] was doing experiments and he got scared of the shield golem [[Narak]] now has. He bumped into a table with a giant vessel on it that fell over on the ground and broke. Inside there was some ooze that took shape into a humanoid form. It was a plasmoid named [[Atrocious]]. [[Nareau]] and [[Atrocious]] introduced themselves and joined the party.

The party went upstairs into [[Gamblion]] and [[Atrocious]] started to scout ahead and reported his finding to the party. Not mayor was found and we went to the first gate to open it. We managed to open the gate and made our way through. Walking down the street we fought 20+- soldiers at the second gate and managed to break it into pieces so the cavalier from the [[Highlord Marshal]] could enter. On arrival of the cavalier, a black shadow dragon flew over. [[Terilin]] flew up with her wings and used all charges of the eldritch staff she had with an eldunary to shoot the dragon down. It crashed further into the city and the magical force pushed [[Terilin]] on the ground.

While the party got besieged with 12 cavaliers and 11 knights with a leader, [[Terilin]] flew towards the crashed dragon alone. [[Nareau]] rescued a a civilian out of a building and after seeying her face he dropped her mid air. After the fight we went towards the dragon but half way we found [[Terilin]]. [[Terilin]] has slain the dragon and as a party we went towards the dragon again. We check if the dragon had an eldunary but is seemed like it did not have one. Nor did we find it having any blood.

The party got informed that there was still a battle going at the other gate of [[Gamblion]]. Here apparently a general of [[The Empire]] battalion was fighting. On arrival we noticed he seemed very powerful since he was shot at with a trebuchet but the boulder exploded near impact without harming him. He was making his final stand since the way out was blocked. 

[[Terilin]] managed to dispel the general and he started shouting of pain. His chest started glowing and rays started coming out of his chest. The rays that were hitting the ground started to melt the surface. Eventually he exploded and the force knocked everything back. Now there was a giant hole in the building he was standing in front off. [[Narak]] ordered his shield golem to support the building while [[Atrocious]] searched the building for survivors. [[Terilin]] found some survivors being held captive behind the building that tried to flee from the back door. 

After some time [[Terilin]] and [[Narak]] started to interrogate and torture the previously survivors, now prisoners, and found out that the black shadow dragon was actually a red dragon that was tainted by shadows. 

We met up with the [[Highlord Marshal]] and start to discuss the situation. This happened in a private setting. [[Geist]] and [[Rigs]] are now being looked for as fugitives. [[Narak]] received a letter from his land stating that he is being accused of murdering his master and parents. 

We had to talk to a couple people to be made nobels to handle the situation in [[Gamblion]] while everyone else is still dealing with [[The Empire]]. Which meant that we spoke to
1. Brann - Dwarf - smith - honest - made nobel
2. Merchant - wants money - in charge of supplies for the city - made nobel after striking a deal. He is prohibited to make profit untill [[Gamblion]] is stabilized. After that he gets 1 year tax free.
3. Fisherman - wants to restore the supply line from the port. - direct  and concerned about his work - laborer - made nobel
4. Garret - made nobel
5. Atreya - made nobel

[[Narak]] went to the dead dragon in the mean time to cleanse the area around it. After cleaning he joined up with [[Atrocious]] to clear up the debris at the gate using the shield golem.

The party met up with [[Leylin]]. First topic was the skeletal dragon that is left over in the city. Conclusion is to store its skeleton to turn it into an undeath at a later point. Also the eldunary in the catacombs has been discussed. We modified [[Narak]] his memory to talk with the eldunary. 

Upon arriving at the eldunary [[Narak]] had no way to communicate with it telepathically so he touches it. 

- Who am I speaking to?
	- [[Glauron]] / massive red dragon
- How did you end up here?
	- Killed by ants
		- Ants are people
- Is it the same ants that put you here?
	- I dont know
- Who killed you?
	- A human called [[The Emperor]]
- When a dragon egg hatches, the hatchling is on its own
- He confirms that [[Ashardalon]] is dead. 
- [[Glauron]] did not kill [[Ashardalon]] and does not know how his father died.
- [[Glauron]] took [[Ashardalon]] his hoard.
- [[Glauron]] showed [[Narak]] a battle between him and a silver dragon with a rider in armor on him. 
- [[Terilin]] in the meantime made preparations to join the conversation.
- We can help each other out, we both want [[The Empire]] gone. 
- Dragon that destroyed [[Pandathaway]] is not [[Ashardalon]]
- Could be a child of [[Glauron]].
- Denies it is working with [[The Empire]]
- It is either above in [[The Empire]] in the hierarchy or they have something it wants.
- [[Glauron]] suggests allying with metal dragons, specifically gold dragons and points us towards finding a thriving area that is doing well. Big chance there is an influence of a golden dragon there. 

Went back to [[Leylin]] to discus the eldunary being used as a bomb. He highly advised to not do it because it will draw the attention of higher so called legendary beings. Mortal yet immortal creatures of great power. Also the spear is being discussed. There are 12 elven dragon slaying spears created in an ancient dragon war by elves. Non were ever found until this one. They are all named after a flower. This one is named after a lily. It has been given to [[Oksana]].
