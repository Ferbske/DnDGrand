Started of at a catacomb in the city of [[Andora]]. In this catacomb we found the [[Hero of the sword]]. We stole its sword and gave it to [[Elisabeth]]. After that we slayed a Dracohydra and received 5 gems from it. That [[Terilin]] brought the gems to [[Leylin]] to learn more about it. The gems were Eldunary. 

We questioned 5 different people that the bishop advised to handle stuff in [[Andora]].
1. Slimebal
2. Open - honest
3. Shit
4. Shit
5. Shit
Nr 2 isnt loyal, he has a side-eye for money. He wants lands in the inner-city. His name is [[Hendrikson]]. The Dracohydra was looted for scales, fangs and claws. 

The party made their way to the [[Dwarven Hold]] before all the energy is dissipated to imbue something each. The hold of a blue adult dragon was in the mountains. Once we entered we found a darkened foggy room where we encountered the blue adult dragon. We slayed him and [[Terilin]] received the hearts and soul. After killing the dragon we took a long rest and got captured  by [[The Empire]]. We escapes, found our gear and killed like 40 guards. In the [[Dwarven Hold]] we freed the youngest dwarf and the rest of the party. Oldest dwarf and arch mage [[Leylin]] are still missing. We entered the hold, killed 2 soldiers and took their clothing for disguises. We chopped them into pieces and discarded them into the toilet.

We persuaded the guards at the gate and found out that the superior was on the 2nd story of a hexagonal shaped dome. The dome is a temple. Underneath it is a prison that can hold 1 person. The dwarf families are hold captive underneath the hold. In total there a re 87 patrols, 4 mages and 300 soldiers in the outer hold. [[Antropos]] expects a report within 16 hours. We went to the [[Temple of Moradin]] and found [[Antropos]] in the middle of the room doing an incantation with the 5 gems floating above his head. We interrupted his incantation and fought him. During the fight we freed [[Leylin]] from that room and fled to the outer wall. [[Leylin]] teleported us after we escaped to [[Hydron]], the city of the dwarfs. 

[[Highlord Marshal]] was making his way to [[Hydron]]. Here we went to [[Baron Bardok]], he has pledged his loyalty to [[Terilin]] but the elders might not. We found out that on top of the mountain there is a plateau where the dwarf god is praised and there is a spiral staircase into the mountain that leads to [[Dwarven Hold]]. 

The party took off towards the mountain from [[Hydron]] to attack the hold with an army of dwarfs. The plan is to polymorph ourselves up the mountain and make preparations with [[Leylin]]. Meanwhile [[Geist]] enters the hold and starts the dwarven revolution. On the plateau a glyph of warding was placed, everyone drank a potion of heroism and [[Kurgan]] drank a potion of growth. We defeated [[Antropos]].

The party entered the stronghold and freed the dwarfs. Peace is back in the hold and the army is gone. We imbued our items.

Then the party went to [[Baron Bardok]] and he was pleased and is willing to help us.

[[Geist]] used an old teleport circle in the stronghold to investigate the other side of the teleport. We ended up in the catacombs of [[Gamblion]]. In these catacombs we found a court wizard names [[Maverick]] doing some kind of research. He was guarded by it seemed like undeath guards. 

[[Highlord Marshal]] and [[Lord Warden Feral]] were informed by what we found. And we needed to go to [[Fallcrest]] because there is a army coming from the east that consist of multiple wild races. Its an army against slavery. [[Saladin]] is leading the army. We send [[Kurgan]] as an emissary for a diplomatic talk. The army consists mostly of demi-humans.

After a while the party left towards the camp where the army is as well where we encountered a loxodon called [[Aldon]] and a tabaxi names [[Twig]]. We sneaked into the camp where [[Geist]] had an epic entrance in the tent with all the leaders, including [[Saladin]]. They don't want to attack and are not associated with [[The Empire]] anymore. We got [[Aldon]] and [[Twig]] with an additional 10 warriors as a warparty. We went to the kobalt stronghold to get [[Kurgan]].

After that we went back to [[Fallcrest]] and went through the portal which leads to the catacombs of [[Gamblion]]. We met again with [[Maverick]] and said he doesn't like working for [[The Empire]] but doesn't want to die. So instead he helps them with research.

In the catacombs we found a mirror where [[Geist]] went through and we seemed to be a one-way portal. He got into a fight with a couple drow. To save him we needed to go through the catacombs and find him. He found 5 rooms in a corridor where in the 3rd room we found murals from historical events and an altar of [[Sindor]]. At the altar we found a drow praying. His name is [[Flonwelf]] of house [[Aufwyndor]]. We found out he is a spy of the house of [[Freth]]. He told us of a secret door to a hallway next to him with drows at a door. [[Rigs]] and [[Terilin]] both casted fireball to kill all drows. Behind the door was [[Geist]]. We went back to [[Flonwelf]] and helped him rescued his buddy that was being a captive in the catacombs.

After we saved [[Geist]] we reunited with [[Narak]] and continued the catacombs. We found a wall with magical darkness with 10 drow with crossbows and 1 female drow and a monk. After the start of combat we encountered an additional enemy, the should golem. We killed them all and [[Rigs]] received the master's amulet to control the golem.

After combat we found an illusionary wall with a giant door behind it. We entered the room and closed the door. The door could only be opened by the family of the bloodline of [[Gamblion]]. Inside the room there was a giant red eldunary and a spear on an altar. We picked up the spear and gave it to [[Narak]]. [[Geist]] started to telepathically talk with the dragon in the eldunary. His name was [[Glauron]], son of [[Ashardalon]]. [[Terilin]] casted detect thoughts on the dragon and overheard the conversation. She interpeted it as if [[Geist]] was making a deal with the dragon for power. So [[Terilin]] casted dominate person on [[Geist]] and forced him to break the telepathic link. [[Rigs]] noticed that there was something off with [[Geist]] and used his golem to grapple [[Terilin]]. He prepared an eldritch blast and questioned [[Geist]] and [[Terilin]].  Once he noticed that it was not [[Geist]] speaking but [[Terilin]], he shot the eldritch blast at [[Terilin]] to break the concentration. [[Geist]] was back himself and a separation was created within the party. The conversation started to escalate but did not reach the point of a fight. Since only [[Terilin]] could open the door meant that the party was stuck. [[Terilin]] opened the door and [[Geist]] and [[Rigs]] left the party. Their freedom was robbed, even only if it was for a minute.

[[Terilin]] and [[Narak]] also left the vault. They encountered [[Nareau]] but did not want to interact with him. While invisible they passed him towards the portal. They entered the room where [[Maverick]] was doing experiments and he got scared of the shield golem [[Narak]] now has. He bumped into a table with a giant vessel on it that fell over on the ground and broke. Inside there was some ooze that took shape into a humanoid form. It was a plasmoid named [[Atrocious]]. [[Nareau]] and [[Atrocious]] introduced themselves and joined the party.

The party went upstairs into [[Gamblion]] and [[Atrocious]] started to scout ahead and reported his finding to the party. Not mayor was found and we went to the first gate to open it. We managed to open the gate and made our way through. Walking down the street we fought 20+- soldiers at the second gate and managed to break it into pieces so the cavalier from the [[Highlord Marshal]] could enter. On arrival of the cavalier, a black shadow dragon flew over. [[Terilin]] flew up with her wings and used all charges of the eldritch staff she had with an eldunary to shoot the dragon down. It crashed further into the city and the magical force pushed [[Terilin]] on the ground.

While the party got besieged with 12 cavaliers and 11 knights with a leader, [[Terilin]] flew towards the crashed dragon alone. [[Nareau]] rescued a a civilian out of a building and after seeying her face he dropped her mid air. After the fight we went towards the dragon but half way we found [[Terilin]]. [[Terilin]] has slain the dragon and as a party we went towards the dragon again. We check if the dragon had an eldunary but is seemed like it did not have one. Nor did we find it having any blood.

The party got informed that there was still a battle going at the other gate of [[Gamblion]]. Here apparently a general of [[The Empire]] battalion was fighting. On arrival we noticed he seemed very powerful since he was shot at with a trebuchet but the boulder exploded near impact without harming him. He was making his final stand since the way out was blocked. 

[[Terilin]] managed to dispel the general and he started shouting of pain. His chest started glowing and rays started coming out of his chest. The rays that were hitting the ground started to melt the surface. Eventually he exploded and the force knocked everything back. Now there was a giant hole in the building he was standing in front off. [[Narak]] ordered his shield golem to support the building while [[Atrocious]] searched the building for survivors. [[Terilin]] found some survivors being held captive behind the building that tried to flee from the back door. 

After some time [[Terilin]] and [[Narak]] started to interrogate and torture the previously survivors, now prisoners, and found out that the black shadow dragon was actually a red dragon that was tainted by shadows. 

We met up with the [[Highlord Marshal]] and start to discuss the situation. This happened in a private setting. [[Geist]] and [[Rigs]] are now being looked for as fugitives. [[Narak]] received a letter from his land stating that he is being accused of murdering his master and parents. 

We had to talk to a couple people to be made nobels to handle the situation in [[Gamblion]] while everyone else is still dealing with [[The Empire]]. Which meant that we spoke to
1. Brann - Dwarf - smith - honest - made nobel
2. Merchant - wants money - in charge of supplies for the city - made nobel after striking a deal. He is prohibited to make profit untill [[Gamblion]] is stabilized. After that he gets 1 year tax free.
3. Fisherman - wants to restore the supply line from the port. - direct  and concerned about his work - laborer - made nobel
4. Garret - made nobel
5. Atreya - made nobel

[[Narak]] went to the dead dragon in the mean time to cleanse the area around it. After cleaning he joined up with [[Atrocious]] to clear up the debris at the gate using the shield golem.

The party met up with [[Leylin]]. First topic was the skeletal dragon that is left over in the city. Conclusion is to store its skeleton to turn it into an undeath at a later point. Also the eldunary in the catacombs has been discussed. We modified [[Narak]] his memory to talk with the eldunary. 

Upon arriving at the eldunary [[Narak]] had no way to communicate with it telepathically so he touches it. 

- Who am I speaking to?
	- [[Glauron]] / massive red dragon
- How did you end up here?
	- Killed by ants
		- Ants are people
- Is it the same ants that put you here?
	- I dont know
- Who killed you?
	- A human called [[The Emperor]]
- When a dragon egg hatches, the hatchling is on its own
- He confirms that [[Ashardalon]] is dead. 
- [[Glauron]] did not kill [[Ashardalon]] and does not know how his father died.
- [[Glauron]] took [[Ashardalon]] his hoard.
- [[Glauron]] showed [[Narak]] a battle between him and a silver dragon with a rider in armor on him. 
- [[Terilin]] in the meantime made preparations to join the conversation.
- We can help each other out, we both want [[The Empire]] gone. 
- Dragon that destroyed [[Pandathaway]] is not [[Ashardalon]]
- Could be a child of [[Glauron]].
- Denies it is working with [[The Empire]]
- It is either above in [[The Empire]] in the hierarchy or they have something it wants.
- [[Glauron]] suggests allying with metal dragons, specifically gold dragons and points us towards finding a thriving area that is doing well. Big chance there is an influence of a golden dragon there. 

Went back to [[Leylin]] to discus the eldunary being used as a bomb. He highly advised to not do it because it will draw the attention of higher so called legendary beings. Mortal yet immortal creatures of great power. Also the spear is being discussed. There are 12 elven dragon slaying spears created in an ancient dragon war by elves. Non were ever found until this one. They are all named after a flower. This one is named after a lily. It has been given to [[Oksana]]. 

We made our way with a arriage and some escorts towards [[Eldercoast]], the lands of [[Narak]] for is accusations. During the travels we found out that the driver of the carriage has his eyes on [[Terilin]]. We found out it was a marshal protecting [[Terilin]] ordered by [[Highlord Marshal]]. During this finding [[Atrocious]] pickpocketed the marshal for a bottle of hard liquor.

On arrival we are welcomed by [[Lady Seraphina Silverthorn]]. We are redirected to a different mansion that is set up for us with defences. [[Narak]] his castle is currently locked and we are not permitted to enter due to investigations of accusations towards [[Narak]]. [[Terilin]] wants to go to [[Narak]] his castle and that can be arranged the next day.

We went towards the mansion to settle in and on our way we saw the academy of [[Eldercoast]]. The trial is set for a week from the current day. The evidense against [[Narak]] are that they found some kind of disease on it that is caused by some very powerfull necromancy and there are not many people capable of doing that. They found books and studies on that matter which is related to [[Narak]]. 

The trial is a trial by jury.
5 votes from the nobles
4 votes from the people
	Consist of 100 randomly choosen citizens that per 25 people cast 1 vote.

[[Oksana]] left the carriage earlier to investigate the matter. In the tavern on the main road she heard a lot of people talking about it and that they want the dark elf killed (refering to [[Narak]]). [[Narak]]'s master was very good for the people and the academy in [[Eldercoast]]. She talked to some people in the bar to get more info.

Former master of [[Eldercoast]] was a good noble but they dont know what happend. Some point he and his family died in weird way by a disease. And now [[Narak]] is a lord and they find it weird that a dark elf is a lord. Lord elfs are not well loved in the area it seems. They think because he has undead that he might have deals with demons. And they recommend talking to one of the servants to get more information on the matter.

[[Atrocious]] went on a mission to investigate the castle that is being investigated for the case against [[Narak]]. He made his way towards the castle and observed the castle for patrols and people going in and out. Send a message by letter towards the party with that information. Also took thoses notes for myself if the letter didnt arrive. After that went he went through the sewer in the castle on the ground floor. Came out of the sink and looked around the first floor not finding much other then some portraits and paintings of nobles. Went upstairs and found my way into the study by climbing the outer wall from balcony to balcony since the main door was locked and had some magic on it.

In the study it was a mess by furniture shoved all over the place. Found a head statue that had some magic on it and a bookcase that is out of place with a hidden entrance behind it. It was a spiral stairs case down below even the ground floor with an alchemy lab. In the middle there was a black cocoon broken open with black goo inside. I took some glass jars and collected some black goo and went by up and made my way out of the castle through the toilet and back to the mansion after I got my backpack again.

[[Terilin]] went towards the castle of [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] and stole a book. On opening the book an alarm spell went off and notified the castle. She got back to the mansion and we read the book. The book contained information on the investigation and the alchemy lab in the castle. Only facts and [[Narak]] was never mentioned and how he is involved in this matter. He made daily notes in the [[Evidense Journal]] but hasnt written in 2 days ago. We suspect that hes dead and want to try find him.

Even though the book is found in the castle of [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] we compared the hand writing with the signature of the letter send to [[Narak]]. They do not match. So either the [[Evidense Journal]] is not written by [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] or the signature. We expect the signature is fake and are worried about the lord.

Idea is to let [[Narak]] prepare locate creature and try find him near [[Narak]]'s castle since that the last thing he has written to go to the location of the investigation again.

In the next morning a paladin from the church of [[Pelor]] came to visit. As soon as he came closer to [[Atrocious]] he felt the paladin irradiating power. His name is [[Aldric Sunblade]]. We notified [[Aldric Sunblade]] that the signature of [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] does not match and he responded that he has seen [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] this morning. The Lord was seen in the barracks.

We were suggested to follow the paladin towards the castle and followed him. Mounted some horses towards the castle and noticed some mysterious figures looking at us. Probably spies of organizations. Could be from nobles or from other organizations.

In the study [[Aldric Sunblade]] explained that the lab below was used for draconic abominations. And they linked it to the invasion of [[Andora]]. 

The trial will have several steps. First they will bring the body of his master and use speak with dead.
Second part is investigating the magical disease (hangman shadow). An unknown disease only done by powerfull necromancers.

The former judge of the case was [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]].

The [[Evidense Journal]] was written by [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] that we stole. So it was stolen by someone and ended at [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]]. And we stole it from there.

A guard found the secret entrance in study by chance?

After some questions were asked to [[Narak]] in a zone of truth, [[Terilin]] was also questioned. She refused to answer in the zone so Mr Tincan ([[Aldric Sunblade]]) dismissed it and continued. After some discussion we exited and went to the mansion.

We came up with a plan and [[Narak]] and [[Oksana]] are going out to the town square. [[Narak]] is going to see what people are doing and try to help out while [[Oksana]] is keeping an eye on him.

[[Narak]] helped out a pushed over cart and a couple people that pushed it over refused to help. After they had a discussion they left while being pickpocketed by [[Oksana]] and received a bag of coins from a hooded man. Then they noticed their missing bag. [[Oksana]] gave their coins to the gnome lady of the cart. [[Narak]] had a small conversation with the people and found out that they were scared of the people from the merchant guild, which is led by  [[Lord Talian Brightblade]]. It seems like people are somewhat scared of that guild.

[[Terilin]] went disguised into the city to talk smack about other nobles and praise [[Narak]] while [[Atrocious]] was keeping an eye out for her.

We got back to the mansion and shared information.

[[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] is invited for a meeting. [[Narak]] casted find creature and on the lord and we verified it was him. We casted zone of truth and he was willing to do it. He arrested someone that had a journal and they expect it was the [[Evidense Journal]] but not sure.

[[Lady Seraphina Silverthorn]] was the noble that set up the council.

A contact/associates of [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] did an investigation and came to the conclusion it was the [[Hangman shadows disease]]. Symptoms are, trouble sleeping, paranoid and dots around the eyes.

Human short dark hair - no tattoos - couple magical items/abilities because he escaped.

Plan is to let [[Oksana]] infiltrate [[Lord Talian Brightblade]]'s castle and [[Atrocious]] gather intel from the backalleys/slumbers of the docking district.

[[Oksana]] went into the estate of [[Lord Talian Brightblade]]. She snuck in and found a hidden entrance towards a small room which seems like an escape route. She heard people talking and stealthed/invisibility in. Found [[Lord Talian Brightblade]] in a room talking to a [[Mysterious hooded man]]. He tracked and left after having a conversation about the [[Evidense Journal]] that he really wants to have. [[Oksana]] followed him into some what of a thieves guild.

In the study of [[Lord Talian Brightblade]] [[Oksana]] found 3 scrolls (Psychic Lance / Wall of Stone / Greater invisibility) and a manuscript in a hidden compartment of the desk. She took these items and in the mansion discussed them matter. The manuscript contained clues of a site of the [[Old Empire]] laying east of [[Gilead]] at the border. The manuscript was written [[Serholm]], who was the founder of the academy and a very powerful mage.

[[Terilin]] placed the [[Evidense Journal]] somewhere where [[Aldric Sunblade]] was able to find it. 

[[Atrocious]] found out the following of his exploits:
The docking district has merchant companies and a criminal underworld. There is a rumor that the [[Thieves guild]] is being controlled by the merchants. To make sure that the merchant company stay on told they bully the lesser companies. Some larger companies also get attacked by the thieves guild. So not all larger companies are involved.

After discussing the situation in the next morning with all party members. [[Terilin]] went to [[Brin]] former captain of the guard who [[Narak]] entrusted. He might know more information about whats going in the backgrounds about the trial and accusations. He has been asked to follow [[Terilin]] back to the mansion to talk with [[Narak]].

[[Atrocious]] is going to find alchemists thay might have a lot of knowledge about necromancy that might be capable of the murder. I found a small alchemist shop somewhere in the city in some dark alley. I talked to her about the situation. She has nothing to do with the murder nor, according to her, does anyone in the city. No one is specialist in this type of necromancy as far as she knows (she is within the underworld). She did tell that some people are asking around about this disease. Further more I asked her about the black goo. It is used to infuse flesh with something. It causes either dead or a lot of pain to the creature. Also asked about the flask I stole from the marshal from the carriage. It seems to be a very potent poison and I left a tiny flask of the poison with her to experiment on it to see what it does for example. She will let someone know in the underworld that she has completed her research in an imbigous way.

Whilst [[Terilin]] is getting [[Brin]], [[Narak]] casted divination to speak with his deity and if able to ask 3 yes/no questions.
1. Is the murderer or the person who ordered the murder part of the council. Yes
2. Is the murderer or the person who ordered the murder a man. No
3. Is this person who ordered or performed the murder, did she welcome us on arrival. No

[[Brin]] arrived at the mansion with [[Narak]]. [[Lady Amara Starfall]] is according to [[Brin]] More in the council as a representer of the academy. She seems neutral. [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] on the other hand is an ex-adventurer and is starting a noble bloodline and is aiming to be important. She is very trained in spellcasting and she takes students. It looks like she wants to start her own magic school. Something did happen this morning at her mansion. The mansion seems to be more fortified then before and [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] went to it, there might have been an intruder which he needs to be informed of. [[Narak]] used sending to see where I was and responded that I was on my way back. [[Atrocious]] told the party about both flask researches and about the intel on the necromancy stuff. Also the flask of poison has been shown about the carriage driver and apparently the marshal is known for infiltration missions and poisons. But no marshal knows his appearance. [[Terilin]] found out about the poison and used [[Narak]]'s sent to tell [[Highlord Marshal]] if he wants his poison marshal dead or alive. Which [[Highlord Marshal]] responded with that the carriage marshal is not in the mansion, which he should have been.

[[Atrocious]] went looking for the carriage driver and after getting told by [[Narak]] that marshal is out of breath and in a haste [[Atrocious]] went back to the undercity to see if there is a commotion anywhere. [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] has been assaulted and injured by something. It got in unnoticed and out through the defensive formations of all guards. They say it was some kind of monster and fleed outside of the city. A other rumor that goes around is that buglars are going missing that use the scewers. There might be some kind of creature hiding there. After searching the scewers [[Atrocious]] found traces of a large heavy monster that has thick black blood. [[Atrocious]] investigated outside of the wall for the infiltration of the [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] estate and found: bare foot prints, no shoes, claws, humanoid shaped feet, spacing of a claws might be same claw marks of the scewers.

[[Oksana]] and [[Terilin]] are going to [[Narak]]'s castle to talk with plants in the study where the murder has been committed. The plant told us that the master was sick when he died. Something bad happened in the ground and later some people came to get the bad thing in the ground. There were 5 people (6 with bad thing). Bad thing looked green, red and blue with a horn. [[Oksana]] and [[Terilin]] went back to [[Narak]] and explained the situation. [[Narak]] attempted to scry the monster but with no success.

[[Terilin]] went to the academy to find more information about [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] and [[Lady Amara Starfall]]. [[Terilin]] is speaking with a contact of hers from the academy. She tells [[Terilin]] about [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] that she wants to set up her own private mage school. [[Lady Amara Starfall]] is find with the current situation and is head mistress for like 10 years. She is a just person. [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] is against [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] to have her own school because she will have to much power.

[[Atrocious]] and [[Terilin]] both came back to the mansion and [[Atrocious]] explained the situation. After explaning the situation the carriage driver came in. He explained that he was fighting a big green monster with red scales and 1 hor. Also had a flail as an arm. He says that he has a different assignment here, he was traveling with us to get here. He was tasked to find our comrade [[Kurgan]]. He clarifies that [[Kurgan]] is indeed the person that was infused in the cacoon. [[Kurgan]] did not infiltrate [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]]'s estate so he probably was kept there inprisoned but he escaped out by going berserk.
