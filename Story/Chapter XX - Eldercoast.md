We made our way with a arriage and some escorts towards [[Eldercoast]], the lands of [[Narak]] for is accusations. During the travels we found out that the driver of the carriage has his eyes on [[Terilin]]. We found out it was a marshal protecting [[Terilin]] ordered by [[Highlord Marshal]]. During this finding [[Atrocious]] pickpocketed the marshal for a bottle of hard liquor.

On arrival we are welcomed by [[Lady Seraphina Silverthorn]]. We are redirected to a different mansion that is set up for us with defences. [[Narak]] his castle is currently locked and we are not permitted to enter due to investigations of accusations towards [[Narak]]. [[Terilin]] wants to go to [[Narak]] his castle and that can be arranged the next day.

We went towards the mansion to settle in and on our way we saw the academy of [[Eldercoast]]. The trial is set for a week from the current day. The evidense against [[Narak]] are that they found some kind of disease on it that is caused by some very powerfull necromancy and there are not many people capable of doing that. They found books and studies on that matter which is related to [[Narak]]. 

The trial is a trial by jury.
5 votes from the nobles
4 votes from the people
	Consist of 100 randomly choosen citizens that per 25 people cast 1 vote.

[[Oksana]] left the carriage earlier to investigate the matter. In the tavern on the main road she heard a lot of people talking about it and that they want the dark elf killed (refering to [[Narak]]). [[Narak]]'s master was very good for the people and the academy in [[Eldercoast]]. She talked to some people in the bar to get more info.

Former master of [[Eldercoast]] was a good noble but they dont know what happend. Some point he and his family died in weird way by a disease. And now [[Narak]] is a lord and they find it weird that a dark elf is a lord. Lord elfs are not well loved in the area it seems. They think because he has undead that he might have deals with demons. And they recommend talking to one of the servants to get more information on the matter.

[[Atrocious]] went on a mission to investigate the castle that is being investigated for the case against [[Narak]]. He made his way towards the castle and observed the castle for patrols and people going in and out. Send a message by letter towards the party with that information. Also took thoses notes for myself if the letter didnt arrive. After that went he went through the sewer in the castle on the ground floor. Came out of the sink and looked around the first floor not finding much other then some portraits and paintings of nobles. Went upstairs and found my way into the study by climbing the outer wall from balcony to balcony since the main door was locked and had some magic on it.

In the study it was a mess by furniture shoved all over the place. Found a head statue that had some magic on it and a bookcase that is out of place with a hidden entrance behind it. It was a spiral stairs case down below even the ground floor with an alchemy lab. In the middle there was a black cocoon broken open with black goo inside. I took some glass jars and collected some black goo and went by up and made my way out of the castle through the toilet and back to the mansion after I got my backpack again.

[[Terilin]] went towards the castle of [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] and stole a book. On opening the book an alarm spell went off and notified the castle. She got back to the mansion and we read the book. The book contained information on the investigation and the alchemy lab in the castle. Only facts and [[Narak]] was never mentioned and how he is involved in this matter. He made daily notes in the [[Evidense Journal]] but hasnt written in 2 days ago. We suspect that hes dead and want to try find him.

Even though the book is found in the castle of [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] we compared the hand writing with the signature of the letter send to [[Narak]]. They do not match. So either the [[Evidense Journal]] is not written by [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] or the signature. We expect the signature is fake and are worried about the lord.

Idea is to let [[Narak]] prepare locate creature and try find him near [[Narak]]'s castle since that the last thing he has written to go to the location of the investigation again.

In the next morning a paladin from the church of [[Pelor]] came to visit. As soon as he came closer to [[Atrocious]] he felt the paladin irradiating power. His name is [[Aldric Sunblade]]. We notified [[Aldric Sunblade]] that the signature of [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] does not match and he responded that he has seen [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] this morning. The Lord was seen in the barracks.

We were suggested to follow the paladin towards the castle and followed him. Mounted some horses towards the castle and noticed some mysterious figures looking at us. Probably spies of organizations. Could be from nobles or from other organizations.

In the study [[Aldric Sunblade]] explained that the lab below was used for draconic abominations. And they linked it to the invasion of [[Andora]]. 

The trial will have several steps. First they will bring the body of his master and use speak with dead.
Second part is investigating the magical disease (hangman shadow). An unknown disease only done by powerfull necromancers.

The former judge of the case was [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]].

The [[Evidense Journal]] was written by [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] that we stole. So it was stolen by someone and ended at [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]]. And we stole it from there.

A guard found the secret entrance in study by chance?

After some questions were asked to [[Narak]] in a zone of truth, [[Terilin]] was also questioned. She refused to answer in the zone so Mr Tincan ([[Aldric Sunblade]]) dismissed it and continued. After some discussion we exited and went to the mansion.

We came up with a plan and [[Narak]] and [[Oksana]] are going out to the town square. [[Narak]] is going to see what people are doing and try to help out while [[Oksana]] is keeping an eye on him.

[[Narak]] helped out a pushed over cart and a couple people that pushed it over refused to help. After they had a discussion they left while being pickpocketed by [[Oksana]] and received a bag of coins from a hooded man. Then they noticed their missing bag. [[Oksana]] gave their coins to the gnome lady of the cart. [[Narak]] had a small conversation with the people and found out that they were scared of the people from the merchant guild, which is led by  [[Lord Talian Brightblade]]. It seems like people are somewhat scared of that guild.

[[Terilin]] went disguised into the city to talk smack about other nobles and praise [[Narak]] while [[Atrocious]] was keeping an eye out for her.

We got back to the mansion and shared information.

[[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] is invited for a meeting. [[Narak]] casted find creature and on the lord and we verified it was him. We casted zone of truth and he was willing to do it. He arrested someone that had a journal and they expect it was the [[Evidense Journal]] but not sure.

[[Lady Seraphina Silverthorn]] was the noble that set up the council.

A contact/associates of [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] did an investigation and came to the conclusion it was the [[Hangman shadows disease]]. Symptoms are, trouble sleeping, paranoid and dots around the eyes.

Human short dark hair - no tattoos - couple magical items/abilities because he escaped.

Plan is to let [[Oksana]] infiltrate [[Lord Talian Brightblade]]'s castle and [[Atrocious]] gather intel from the backalleys/slumbers of the docking district.

[[Oksana]] went into the estate of [[Lord Talian Brightblade]]. She snuck in and found a hidden entrance towards a small room which seems like an escape route. She heard people talking and stealthed/invisibility in. Found [[Lord Talian Brightblade]] in a room talking to a [[Mysterious hooded man]]. He tracked and left after having a conversation about the [[Evidense Journal]] that he really wants to have. [[Oksana]] followed him into some what of a thieves guild.

In the study of [[Lord Talian Brightblade]] [[Oksana]] found 3 scrolls (Psychic Lance / Wall of Stone / Greater invisibility) and a manuscript in a hidden compartment of the desk. She took these items and in the mansion discussed them matter. The manuscript contained clues of a site of the [[Old Empire]] laying east of [[Gilead]] at the border. The manuscript was written [[Serholm]], who was the founder of the academy and a very powerful mage.

[[Terilin]] placed the [[Evidense Journal]] somewhere where [[Aldric Sunblade]] was able to find it. 

[[Atrocious]] found out the following of his exploits:
The docking district has merchant companies and a criminal underworld. There is a rumor that the [[Thieves guild]] is being controlled by the merchants. To make sure that the merchant company stay on told they bully the lesser companies. Some larger companies also get attacked by the thieves guild. So not all larger companies are involved.

After discussing the situation in the next morning with all party members. [[Terilin]] went to [[Brin]] former captain of the guard who [[Narak]] entrusted. He might know more information about whats going in the backgrounds about the trial and accusations. He has been asked to follow [[Terilin]] back to the mansion to talk with [[Narak]].

[[Atrocious]] is going to find alchemists thay might have a lot of knowledge about necromancy that might be capable of the murder. I found a small alchemist shop somewhere in the city in some dark alley. I talked to her about the situation. She has nothing to do with the murder nor, according to her, does anyone in the city. No one is specialist in this type of necromancy as far as she knows (she is within the underworld). She did tell that some people are asking around about this disease. Further more I asked her about the black goo. It is used to infuse flesh with something. It causes either dead or a lot of pain to the creature. Also asked about the flask I stole from the marshal from the carriage. It seems to be a very potent poison and I left a tiny flask of the poison with her to experiment on it to see what it does for example. She will let someone know in the underworld that she has completed her research in an imbigous way.

Whilst [[Terilin]] is getting [[Brin]], [[Narak]] casted divination to speak with his deity and if able to ask 3 yes/no questions.
1. Is the murderer or the person who ordered the murder part of the council. Yes
2. Is the murderer or the person who ordered the murder a man. No
3. Is this person who ordered or performed the murder, did she welcome us on arrival. No

[[Brin]] arrived at the mansion with [[Narak]]. [[Lady Amara Starfall]] is according to [[Brin]] More in the council as a representer of the academy. She seems neutral. [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] on the other hand is an ex-adventurer and is starting a noble bloodline and is aiming to be important. She is very trained in spellcasting and she takes students. It looks like she wants to start her own magic school. Something did happen this morning at her mansion. The mansion seems to be more fortified then before and [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] went to it, there might have been an intruder which he needs to be informed of. [[Narak]] used sending to see where I was and responded that I was on my way back. [[Atrocious]] told the party about both flask researches and about the intel on the necromancy stuff. Also the flask of poison has been shown about the carriage driver and apparently the marshal is known for infiltration missions and poisons. But no marshal knows his appearance. [[Terilin]] found out about the poison and used [[Narak]]'s sent to tell [[Highlord Marshal]] if he wants his poison marshal dead or alive. Which [[Highlord Marshal]] responded with that the carriage marshal is not in the mansion, which he should have been.

[[Atrocious]] went looking for the carriage driver and after getting told by [[Narak]] that marshal is out of breath and in a haste [[Atrocious]] went back to the undercity to see if there is a commotion anywhere. [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] has been assaulted and injured by something. It got in unnoticed and out through the defensive formations of all guards. They say it was some kind of monster and fleed outside of the city. A other rumor that goes around is that buglars are going missing that use the scewers. There might be some kind of creature hiding there. After searching the scewers [[Atrocious]] found traces of a large heavy monster that has thick black blood. [[Atrocious]] investigated outside of the wall for the infiltration of the [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] estate and found: bare foot prints, no shoes, claws, humanoid shaped feet, spacing of a claws might be same claw marks of the scewers.

[[Oksana]] and [[Terilin]] are going to [[Narak]]'s castle to talk with plants in the study where the murder has been committed. The plant told us that the master was sick when he died. Something bad happened in the ground and later some people came to get the bad thing in the ground. There were 5 people (6 with bad thing). Bad thing looked green, red and blue with a horn. [[Oksana]] and [[Terilin]] went back to [[Narak]] and explained the situation. [[Narak]] attempted to scry the monster but with no success.

[[Terilin]] went to the academy to find more information about [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] and [[Lady Amara Starfall]]. [[Terilin]] is speaking with a contact of hers from the academy. She tells [[Terilin]] about [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] that she wants to set up her own private mage school. [[Lady Amara Starfall]] is find with the current situation and is head mistress for like 10 years. She is a just person. [[Lord Galladorn Emberwind]] is against [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] to have her own school because she will have to much power.

[[Atrocious]] and [[Terilin]] both came back to the mansion and [[Atrocious]] explained the situation. After explaning the situation the carriage driver came in. He explained that he was fighting a big green monster with red scales and 1 horn. Also had a flail as an arm. He says that he has a different assignment here, he was traveling with us to get here. He was tasked to find our comrade [[Kurgan]]. He clarifies that [[Kurgan]] is indeed the person that was infused in the cacoon. [[Kurgan]] did not infiltrate [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]]'s estate so he probably was kept there inprisoned but he escaped out by going berserk.

The carriage marchal came in and we spoke with him. He kept some information for himself but he was investigating [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]]'s mansion. Then he left and said he was going at tend to the horses. Which was obviously a lie.

The party went in the sewers and we found [[Kurgan]] fighting some adventurers. We started the encounter and tied [[Kurgan]] with pitons on the ground. [[Atrocious]] slid his ankles and he fell over. Command was used on [[Kurgan]] and Charm. We managed to bring [[Kurgan]] back to his senses and fed him arms and legs from the adventurers on the ground. [[Narak]] extracted the corrupted blood out of [[Kurgan]] and we filled 2 waterskins with it that [[Atrocious]] and [[Narak]] have.

[[Caehanna]] was ordered with the other adventures by a [[Pale man in black clothes]]. The pale guy was an administrator who gives bounties and there was a bounty on Kurgans head. There was a small introduction of [[Caehanna]] and [[Atrocious]] left the sewers to find information on the whereabouts of [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]]. From the information he gathered he found out that [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] is in her mansion. The party left the sewers as well towards a church of [[Pelor]].

The party arrived at the temple and found [[Aldric Sunblade]]. They show [[Kurgan]]'s corrupted blood and are allowed to go inside. The blood is used as evidense and we are advised to stick together. Upon leaving the temple [[Atrocious]] was standing outside and brought the party to a very nice establishment (whore house). [[Kurgan]] is smashing everything he can while the rest is in the lounge drinking some stuff. [[Caehanna]] was dancing on a stripperpole.

After taking a sleep in the morning we went back to the mansion. The guards are suprised that we are not inside. After some time we are guided to the courthouse for the trial. In the trial hall, [[Kurgan]] recognises [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] and the other one [[Kurgan]] points at is the [[Pale man in black clothes]]. During the trial everyone was silent because of the pressure of [[Aldric Sunblade]]. The evidense was shown, including the corrupted blood from [[Kurgan]]. The situation leads to [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]]. While she going in protest the [[Pale man in black clothes]] behind [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] stands-up and in a short time the room rumbles and the roof is slowly collapsing and falling apart for a bid. A big whole in the ceiling is created and [[Aldric Sunblade]] and [[Pale man in black clothes]] are gone. We hear a extremly loud noices of a battle. [[Terilin]] is flying upwards towards the battle.

In the courthouse [[Oksana]] does detect thoughts on [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] and she is trying to escape, to prevent this [[Oksana]] casts hunters mark and attacks her. A fight within the courthouse starts. [[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] is one-shotted instantly. Outside a battle went down with the [[Pale man in black clothes]], [[Aldric Sunblade]] striked down the [[Pale man in black clothes]] after some help from the party. During the battle [[Terilin]] got impaled by bones and got hurt a lot. After the battle [[Terilin]] was saved and caught while falling. After that she got healed for a bit and she shouted that [[Lord Talian Brightblade]] had to be killed. [[Atrocious]] and [[Caehanna]] rushed towards him and a fireball was casted by [[Caehanna]] and [[Atrocious]] finished him off.

[[Lady Elowen Frostwind]] got blue robes and a bag that [[Caehanna]] looted.
[[Lord Talian Brightblade]] got a bag of holding with a shit load of money that [[Atrocious]] looted.

TODO - Nico needs to tell us what was the loot exactly.
TODO - lvl up
TODO - Recontainer the waterskin of corrupted blood
