We modified [[Narak]] his memory to talk with the eldunary. 

Upon arriving at the eldunary [[Narak]] had no way to communicate with it telepathically so he touches it. 

- Who am I speaking to?
	- [[Glauron]] / massive red dragon
- How did you end up here?
	- Killed by ants
		- Ants are people
- Is it the same ants that put you here?
	- I dont know
- Who killed you?
	- A human called [[The Emperor]]
- When a dragon egg hatches, the hatchling is on its own
- He confirms that [[Ashardalon]] is dead. 
- [[Glauron]] did not kill [[Ashardalon]] and does not know how his father died.
- [[Glauron]] took [[Ashardalon]] his hoard.
- [[Glauron]] showed [[Narak]] a battle between him and a silver dragon with a rider in armor on him. 
- [[Terilin]] in the meantime made preparations to join the conversation.
- We can help each other out, we both want [[The Empire]] gone. 
- Dragon that destroyed [[Pandathaway]] is not [[Ashardalon]]
- Could be a child of [[Glauron]].
- Denies it is working with [[The Empire]]
- It is either above in [[The Empire]] in the hierarchy or they have something it wants.
- [[Glauron]] suggests allying with metal dragons, specifically gold dragons and points us towards finding a thriving area that is doing well. Big chance there is an influence of a golden dragon there. 

Went back to [[Leylin]] to discus the eldunary being used as a bomb. He highly advised to not do it because it will draw the attention of higher so called legendary beings. Mortal yet immortal creatures of great power. Also the spear is being discussed. There are 12 elven dragon slaying spears created in an ancient dragon war by elves. Non were ever found until this one. They are all named after a flower. This one is named after a lily. It has been given to [[Lemuru]].
