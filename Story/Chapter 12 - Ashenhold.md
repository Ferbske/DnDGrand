We travel towards [[Ashenhold]] and on our way though the mountains we see green torches. It takes the entire day and in the evening to get through the mountains. We walked through a forest and set up camp. During the watch we saw nothing (rolled 1, 1 and 2). We continued walking the next day and see a city in the distance.

We walked towards the city and we see just the casual traffic going in and out. [[Atrocious]] says he is going to KAKKA KAKKA! When he sees the person/being that is trying to become a god. The party went looking for churches that could be from that new 'god'. During the search [[Atrocious]] left and went looking on its own. The rest of the party found a church that could be the makeshift god. They entered and [[Narak]] casted detect magic. He notices divine and illusion magic. At the end of the church there is an altar and a being that is called [[The Morning Lord]]. [[Terilin]] casts dispell magic on [[The Morning Lord]] at the altar. He radiates bright light and that slowly turns to red and then to black. His appearance turns from humanoid whiteropes to an angelic appearance with wings that slowly turns into just the framework of wings left. Chains come out of his body into the air and slowly fade away. [[Lemuru]] uses detect thought and inner thoughts. His thoughts are 'These low life humans, GET THEM!'. 100 humans in the church pray for him and started to panic. The 100 people turn around and start running to the party. [[Caehanna]] casts circle of death and massacres around half of the people in the church. Followed by [[Terilin]] casting disintegrate on [[The Morning Lord]]. [[Atrocious]] jumped through the lead stained glass as a surprise attact with a crit, stabbed him in the back twice and hid. Followed by [[Lemuru]] shooting a lightning arrow and killed [[The Morning Lord]]. The remaining 20 humans ran towards [[Narak]] while he summons a celestial being at the altar and orders the humans to stop. The celestial being did not manage to stop the humans. The humans ran towards [[Narak]] and missed. Some hit [[Caehanna]] and [[Lemuru]]. The entire party went invisible and left [[Ashenhold]]. We met up with [[Leylin]] who left as soon as the battle began. [[Leylin]] was not happy since we massacred multiple innocent people.

[[Atrocious]] and [[Terilin]] stealthed back in the city and church so [[Atrocious]] can investigate. On investigation he found out that the body of [[The Morning Lord]] was an illusion which also caused that his invisibility was gone. He got noticed and escaped the city.

There is a [[Atrocious]] plan to find the black hand within [[Ashenhold]] and see if there is a big organisation that has a big debt for the black hand. And if that they want that organisation to have the blame for the attack on the church. If yes then [[Atrocious]] will say that `the one with many faces` will execute the plan.
