We entered the ritual room and [[Leylin]] prepared the teleportation spell. We get sucked into the spacial point and fall on the ground within a field of grass in the middle of butt fuck no where. Time of day is still early morning. [[Leylin]] does not seem to be nearby. We arrived not in the location we wanted but nearby. We arrived south of [[Teirm]] and close to the main city which is south of us within the mountains called [[Urubaen]]. We need to go closer towards [[Teirm]] for the towers location.

After an hours walking we see farms and roads. In the distance we see people working. Not a lot of them.

After a full day of walking late in the evening we setup 2 tents and [[Atrocious]] did camouflage the golem. During the nights watch a shadow was seen moving back and forward. It was a big bear and on the 3rd watch [[Lemuru]] used the left over food to lure him away and give him the remaining food.
