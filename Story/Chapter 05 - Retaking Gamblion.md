The party went upstairs into [[Gamblion]] and [[Atrocious]] started to scout ahead and reported his finding to the party. Not mayor was found and we went to the first gate to open it. We managed to open the gate and made our way through. Walking down the street we fought 20+- soldiers at the second gate and managed to break it into pieces so the cavalier from the [[Highlord Marshall]] could enter. On arrival of the cavalier, a black shadow dragon flew over. [[Terilin]] flew up with her wings and used all charges of the eldritch staff she had with an eldunary to shoot the dragon down. It crashed further into the city and the magical force pushed [[Terilin]] on the ground.

While the party got besieged with 12 cavaliers and 11 knights with a leader, [[Terilin]] flew towards the crashed dragon alone. [[Nareau]] rescued a a civilian out of a building and after seeying her face he dropped her mid air. After the fight we went towards the dragon but half way we found [[Terilin]]. [[Terilin]] has slain the dragon and as a party we went towards the dragon again. We check if the dragon had an eldunary but is seemed like it did not have one. Nor did we find it having any blood.

The party got informed that there was still a battle going at the other gate of [[Gamblion]]. Here apparently a general of [[The Empire]] battalion was fighting. On arrival we noticed he seemed very powerful since he was shot at with a trebuchet but the boulder exploded near impact without harming him. He was making his final stand since the way out was blocked. 

[[Terilin]] managed to dispel the general and he started shouting of pain. His chest started glowing and rays started coming out of his chest. The rays that were hitting the ground started to melt the surface. Eventually he exploded and the force knocked everything back. Now there was a giant hole in the building he was standing in front off. [[Narak]] ordered his shield golem to support the building while [[Atrocious]] searched the building for survivors. [[Terilin]] found some survivors being held captive behind the building that tried to flee from the back door. 

After some time [[Terilin]] and [[Narak]] started to interrogate and torture the previously survivors, now prisoners, and found out that the black shadow dragon was actually a red dragon that was tainted by shadows. 

We met up with the [[Highlord Marshall]] and start to discuss the situation. This happened in a private setting. [[Geist]] and [[Rigs]] are now being looked for as fugitives. [[Narak]] received a letter from his land stating that he is being accused of murdering his master and parents. 

We had to talk to a couple people to be made nobels to handle the situation in [[Gamblion]] while everyone else is still dealing with [[The Empire]]. Which meant that we spoke to
1. Brann - Dwarf - smith - honest - made nobel
2. Merchant - wants money - in charge of supplies for the city - made nobel after striking a deal. He is prohibited to make profit untill [[Gamblion]] is stabilized. After that he gets 1 year tax free.
3. Fisherman - wants to restore the supply line from the port. - direct  and concerned about his work - laborer - made nobel
4. Garret - made nobel
5. Atreya - made nobel

[[Narak]] went to the dead dragon in the mean time to cleanse the area around it. After cleaning he joined up with [[Atrocious]] to clear up the debris at the gate using the shield golem.

The party met up with [[Leylin]]. First topic was the skeletal dragon that is left over in the city. Conclusion is to store its skeleton to turn it into an undeath at a later point. Also the eldunary in the catacombs has been discussed.
