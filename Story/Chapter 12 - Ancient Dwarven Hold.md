We all get teleported to [[Leylin]]. We got teleported near the area and hear a lot of noice coming from the ravine and see flashes in the distance. We make our way to the noice. [[Leylin]] is missing his right arm. We did some AoE within the ravine and [[Lemuru]]'s drake picked up [[Leylin]] and brought him up to us on top of the ravine. [[Leylin]] says we need to get out fast since a big red dragon is coming our way in the back. We ran towards the nearby city, turned invisible and then turned towards the mountains/a [[Ancient Dwarven Hold]].

We ran to a ravine near the mountains in a small cravase and went in a sort of cave. It lead to a spherical room with a vertical wall. There should be a door but we cant find it. Detect magic says its abjuration. The entire wall is cold like stone. Dispell only caused a ripple in the abjuration spell. We still dont get the door opened even with eldritch blast. [[Narak]] used dimension door to get to the otherside and brought [[Leylin]] with him. On the otherside they see a large rectangular room which is massive with dead dwarven corpses. The door seems to open with a combination of 2 different mechanics next to the door on the inside. [[Narak]] and [[Leylin]] try to open the door. The massive gate turns on its centre. We all go in and we close the massive door behind us. While investigation the dead dwarves we see an insignia but we do not recognise it. Even their remains and armour do not give anything away how they have died. With speak dead reveal they were attacked by drow. They attacked from below. He says its in year 873 but it is now 342. And before that is only went to 932. So that is 401 years ago. Drow do live quite a long time.

We decided to take a long rest within a guardhouse. [[Narak]] recovered [[Leylin]]'s arm.

We teleported a kilometer next to the [[Plainwalkers Tower]].
