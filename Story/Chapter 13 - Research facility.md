In [[Gilead]] we went shopping.

[[Terilin]] sold blue dragon teeth/fangs/heart/blood to the alchemist of [[Gilead]] and he now owes [[Terilin]] for 17.000.

[[Narak]] traded blue dragon hide for a immovable rod + 5.000 gold. He is looking for an arcane eye. 

[[Atrocious]] went to the [[Highlord Marshal]] and asked for a dagger. He had a dagger of silent demise and wanted to trade it for the dagger +1. [[Atrocious]] tried to deceive him but failed and the trade is made.

The party got teleported back to [[Gamblion]] and took a day for some other preparations that [[Terilin]] wanted (OC discussion between Mila and Nico).
After that day we used the portal to the research facility. We entered an entirely small dark room and the small corridor out of the room is collapsed. [[Atrocious]] tries to light a torch but fails because of [[Narak]]. All non-magical fire is automatically extinquished. [[Terilin]] uses the wand of secrets to see secrets and notices a secret tunnel further behind the collapsed corridor. The shieldgolem excavates the collapsed corridor and as soon as there is a small whole that fits [[Atrocious]] he slithers through it. On the other side he sees a platform in a large rectangular room. Its a unfinished room being carved out with corpses on the ground. I see a small humanoid with a big backpack rummiging through the corpses. [[Atrocious]] tries to get closer and on the 30ft mark the humanoid notices him and shouts some things and all of a sudden there is a fog. This fog is dispelled by [[Narak]] and the humanoid is gone. There now are 3 miner skeleboys, 2 guard skeleboys and some kind of undeath spellcaster.

All undead were slain. And the earlier [[Terilin]] has detected a secret and the tile on the wall was broken by [[Caehanna]] and [[Narak]] by eldritch blast which destroyed everything behind. There was a destroyed looking small fancy chest with splinters of glass. There was a lot of liqued spilled which was slurped up by [[Atrocious]].

Next smaller room there was a tomb (sarcophasus) that [[Atrocious]] and [[Caehanna]] tried to open. [[Terilin]] was against it but by saying `Yes` to a different question that [[Atrocious]] misheard he still tried. Some spells were cast against [[Atrocious]]. After 2 attempts suggestion was cast on him with the word `Go to the portal room and go home`. His interpretation was to go to the room but realized he has no home. His definition of home was with the party since he doesn't have one. Further down the the next door there were 2 ways to go. Right side has noices of water. Left side at the end has the humanoids head looking at us. He was not found by detect good or evil. As soon has he notices that [[Atrocious]] sees him he runs. After a bit the party went left corridor. That lead to 2 more hallways, 1 up and one right. We took the right one and at the end was a small room with a pedestal. In the room there were 2 statues that looked like knights. The pedestal had some text on in that [[Atrocious]] and [[Caehanna]] couldn't read it. The shieldgolem broke the pedestal plaque and behind it was a fancy looking chest with 8 holy water vials. [[Narak]] distributed 2 to everyone and not keeping any for himself. [[Atrocious]] drank 1 of the vials to verify it was the same as the liquid before. It was holy water and he is now poisoned and feels sick. But due to his poison resistance he isn't sick sick but feels unwell.

After that room we backtracked to the previous hallway split and went upwards. We ended up at a crossroad with tracks going everywhere except towards the well in the middle of the crossroad. The well in the middle had a small ring near it that was found by [[Narak]] by detect magic. He tried to take it with mage hand and after a couple ft dragging the ring vines popped out of the ground trying to entangle the mage hand. He used the mage hand to fling the ring towards himself passed the vines area. The ring was a ring of obscurring.

1= Across the well the hallways goes down. Has footsteps going in only.
2= Left goes 30ft and then down. Which had footsteps in and out of it.
3= Right side goes down as well. No steps at all.

The crossroad room had a secret door which is air sealed. After removing some sealant there was steam coming out of it continuously. We went back in the corridor we came from and continuously used mage hand to open the sealant. The door exploded and we went in. Behind the door were some pools of water with red runes around it. The runes were runes to heated the water. It seems like the secret was ment as a pressurized trap.

1= Went down the room and is freezing cold. The entire floor is conjuration magic and is iced out. The ice reflects the ceiling. In the middle of the room there is a giant onyx stone. [[Atrocious]] skated around the ice and this room has 2 more directions.
	4= Left going down
	5= Straight goes up
[[Caehanna]] and [[Terilin]] also went on the ice to got to direct 5=. Upon reaching the middle 3 shadows came out of the floor which looked like exact copies of [[Atrocious]], [[Caehanna]] and [[Terilin]]. We fought 3 clones of us that looked shadowy.

4= We entered this corridor and it lead to a steel door with engraved monsters and knight fighting eachother. It is extremly cold here. Monsters are minotaurs, gryphons and such. It looks like a battlefield, an army against a kinds of manner of creatures. It has mountains behind the creatures. It seems like the army is from the [[Old Empire]]. It depicts [[Old Empire]] at its greatest. It seems that the [[Shield Mountains]] is the border. And depicted in the back. It seems like the [[Old Empire]] pressured all monsters back behind these mountains to expand their territory. The steel door seems to be frozen and [[Atrocious]] nearly got frozen trying to touch it.

The party went back to the room with the skeleboys for a long rest but we set up the trap at the sarcophasus which spawned a wraith. After the fight the sarcophasus has nice clothing, a silver/gold crown with a ruby in it and a longsword. [[Atrocious]] grabs the crown and puts it inside hes bag of holding and he grabs the clothing as well. The sword is still in the sarcophasus because it is cursed. The crown has a conjuration aura. The party held a long rest and after the rest [[Atrocious]] also grabbed the longsword and puts it in the bag of holding.

The party went back to the steel door, eldritch blasted that mofo and we are at the entrance of giant room. This room has a ice globe in the middle, a balustrade around the room with some frozen bodies on it. It has 6 giant onyx's (like the ice room) with blue runes on it. [[Narak]] used a mage hand with robes to drag a body towards him and tried to speak with them with speak of death. Did not work. [[Narak]] casted a fireball at the sphere but over the distance the fire was doushed and impact did nothing. During that fireball he got grappled by the undead body underneath him and the fight has started against 6 undead. The fight continued with some pillars being destroyed and that cracked ice sphere in the centre. A giant wraith looking king was inside together with still big but smaller wraiths. The King was banished for a round and had some struggles with the fight. We managed to kill every enemy and saved 1 pillar of the 6. During the fight [[Atrocious]] bag of holding broke by the cursed sword that was used by the King. All stuff inside was all over the place including the gold.

6892 total gold on ground
2400 on [[Atrocious]]
4492 on [[Narak]]
