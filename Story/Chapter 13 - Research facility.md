In [[Gilead]] we went shopping.

[[Terilin]] sold blue dragon teeth/fangs/heart/blood to the alchemist of [[Gilead]] and he now owes [[Terilin]] for 17.000.

[[Narak]] traded blue dragon hide for a immovable rod + 5.000 gold. He is looking for an arcane eye. 

[[Atrocious]] went to the [[Highlord Marshal]] and asked for a dagger. He had a dagger of silent demise and wanted to trade it for the dagger +1. [[Atrocious]] tried to deceive him but failed and the trade is made.

The party got teleported back to [[Gamblion]] and took a day for some other preparations that [[Terilin]] wanted (OC discussion between Mila and Nico).
After that day we used the portal to the research facility. We entered an entirely small dark room and the small corridor out of the room is collapsed. [[Atrocious]] tries to light a torch but fails because of [[Narak]]. All non-magical fire is automatically extinquished. [[Terilin]] uses the wand of secrets to see secrets and notices a secret tunnel further behind the collapsed corridor. The shieldgolem excavates the collapsed corridor and as soon as there is a small whole that fits [[Atrocious]] he slithers through it. On the other side he sees a platform in a large rectangular room. Its a unfinished room being carved out with corpses on the ground. I see a small humanoid with a big backpack rummiging through the corpses. [[Atrocious]] tries to get closer and on the 30ft mark the humanoid notices him and shouts some things and all of a sudden there is a fog. This fog is dispelled by [[Narak]] and the humanoid is gone. There now are 3 miner skeleboys, 2 guard skeleboys and some kind of undeath spellcaster.

All undead were slain. And the earlier [[Terilin]] has detected a secret and the tile on the wall was broken by [[Caehanna]] and [[Narak]] by eldritch blast which destroyed everything behind. There was a destroyed looking small fancy chest with splinters of glass. There was a lot of liqued spilled which was slurped up by [[Atrocious]].

Next smaller room there was a tomb (sarcophasus) that [[Atrocious]] and [[Caehanna]] tried to open. [[Terilin]] was against it but by saying `Yes` to a different question that [[Atrocious]] misheard he still tried. Some spells were cast against [[Atrocious]]. After 2 attempts suggestion was cast on him with the word `Go to the portal room and go home`. His interpretation was to go to the room but realized he has no home. His definition of home was with the party since he doesn't have one. Further down the the next door there were 2 ways to go. Right side has noices of water. Left side at the end has the humanoids head looking at us. He was not found by detect good or evil. As soon has he notices that [[Atrocious]] sees him he runs. After a bit the party went left corridor. That lead to 2 more hallways, 1 up and one right. We took the right one and at the end was a small room with a pedestal. In the room there were 2 statues that looked like knights. The pedestal had some text on in that [[Atrocious]] and [[Caehanna]] couldn't read it. The shieldgolem broke the pedestal plaque and behind it was a fancy looking chest with 8 holy water vials. [[Narak]] distributed 2 to everyone and not keeping any for himself. [[Atrocious]] drank 1 of the vials to verify it was the same as the liquid before. It was holy water and he is now poisoned and feels sick. But due to his poison resistance he isn't sick sick but feels unwell.

After that room we backtracked to the previous hallway split and went upwards. We ended up at a crossroad with tracks going everywhere except towards the well in the middle of the crossroad. The well in the middle had a small ring near it that was found by [[Narak]] by detect magic. He tried to take it with mage hand and after a couple ft dragging the ring vines popped out of the ground trying to entangle the mage hand. He used the mage hand to fling the ring towards himself passed the vines area. The ring was a ring of obscurring.

1= Across the well the hallways goes down. Has footsteps going in only.
2= Left goes 30ft and then down. Which had footsteps in and out of it.
3= Right side goes down as well. No steps at all.

The crossroad room had a secret door which is air sealed. After removing some sealant there was steam coming out of it continuously. We went back in the corridor we came from and continuously used mage hand to open the sealant. The door exploded and we went in. Behind the door were some pools of water with red runes around it. The runes were runes to heated the water. It seems like the secret was ment as a pressurized trap.

1= Went down the room and is freezing cold. The entire floor is conjuration magic and is iced out. The ice reflects the ceiling. In the middle of the room there is a giant onyx stone. [[Atrocious]] skated around the ice and this room has 2 more directions.
	4= Left going down
	5= Straight goes up
[[Caehanna]] and [[Terilin]] also went on the ice to got to direct 5=. Upon reaching the middle 3 shadows came out of the floor which looked like exact copies of [[Atrocious]], [[Caehanna]] and [[Terilin]]. We fought 3 clones of us that looked shadowy.
