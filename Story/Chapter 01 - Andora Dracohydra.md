Started of at a catacomb in the city of [[Andora]]. In this catacomb we found the [[Hero of the sword]]. We stole its sword and gave it to [[Elisabeth]]. After that we slayed a Dracohydra and received 5 gems from it. That [[Terilin]] brought the gems to [[Leylin]] to learn more about it. The gems were Eldunary. 

We questioned 5 different people that the bishop advised to handle stuff in [[Andora]].
1. Slimebal
2. Open - honest
3. Shit
4. Shit
5. Shit
Nr 2 isnt loyal, he has a side-eye for money. He wants lands in the inner-city. His name is [[Hendrikson]]. The Dracohydra was looted for scales, fangs and claws.
